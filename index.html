                I am a 18 year old developer, but I have been programming since I was 8/9. I have
                experience with several different programming languages and SDKs. My favorite platform is the
                web, and my favorite programing language is JavaScript. In the past I have experimented with developing PWAs,
                I've done API development with NodeJS and Express, database development with NodeJS, database management with 
                MongoDB and Firebase, Android Development with Android Studio and Java, Flutter Development, and much
                more! I am also proficient in Java and the Java Swing libraries for GUI development. Furthermore, I have a
                good amount of experience making Discord bots and chatbots in general, using RiveScript. My age may
                be limited, but clearly my experience is not.

                        A janky-ish, in-development, web-framework. I mainly developed this framework because I was bored during 
                        quarantine, but hey why not put it online ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Don't expect it to work amazingly, and definitely don't 
                        expect it to work all the time. This project is currently not in a place I would recommend for 
                        distribution... Let's call this v0.0.1 beta.

                        Using machine learning with ML5 and Tensorflow this is a website that has been trained on pre-existing
                        blocks of text that it is able to use to generate new chunks of text. The models are pre-trained so that
                        performance is optimal on most devices. Simply open the website, plug in a few parameters, choose 
                        a model from a dropdown and hit run.
